#### Please fork this repository and push your responses. You should only need to run `npm install` and `npm start` to get started. You can run `./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js app.js` to utilize nodemon as well. Any node version 17+ should suffice.

#### The goal is to get every name stored in the `user` variable to display on the page without hard coding. How could we do this within our `ul` element?

#### Reach out to the Coach Coordinator via email or slack if you run into any issues!
